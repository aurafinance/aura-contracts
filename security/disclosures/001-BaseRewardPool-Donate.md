| Effects            | Additional AURA can be minted outside of the distribution schedule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Description        | A user can cause additional AURA to be minted outside of the distribution schedule by sending additional BAL to the rewards contracts as AURA is minted based on the amount of BAL rewards being claimed.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Steps to reproduce | <ul><li>Control more than 50% of a single pool</li><li>Call donate on the target reward pool to add BAL to the queued rewards amount</li><li>Queue the rewards by calling Booster.earmarkRewards for pools that are not shutdown or BaseRewardPool.processIdleRewards for pools that are shutdown.</li><li>Wait for the reward period to pass claim your BAL rewards and the prorata AURA rewards</li></ul> |
| Details of fix     | The Booster and BaseRewardPool contract were redeployed with the donate functionality removed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
