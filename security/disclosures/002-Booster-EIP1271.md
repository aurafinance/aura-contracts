| Effects            | Arbitrary approvals can be set for tokens supporting EIP1271 permit owned by the VoterProxy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Description        | Aura governance is supervised by a 4/7 multisig that is composed of 3 Aura Contributors, 2 Balancer Ballers and 2 reputable/known DeFi community members. To vote on Balancers offchain governance the VoterProxy uses EIP1271 signature validation. This method of validation can also be used to set token approvals. The gauges that are used by Balancer include this signature validation functionality for approvals. |
| Steps to reproduce | <ul><li>Call setVote on the voter proxy via the Booster with a hash that represents a token approval permit</li><li>On the target token call transferFrom passing in the voterProxy address, destination address and the amount</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Details of fix     | Booster redeployed with the setVote function removed. A delegate function was added to allow the VoterProxy to delegate it's offchain snapshot voting power to the Aura Multisig. Past signatures were all set to be invalid to avoid potential clashes.                                                                                                                                                                    |
